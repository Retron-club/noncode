Blockchain is nothing without hashing. 
Hashing is the most important part of blockchain.

Let's dive deep into the hashing algorithm ->

The algorithm which converts input data of any length into a string of fixed size.
That strig of fixed size is also called as hash value.

EX-> "I am Himanshu Sharma" --> Converted into 3C43B43K4353535H3LKKLH353L. (This value is called hash)

Hashing has 2 unique properties -> 
1) Irreversibility -> After hashing any data it can't be de-hashed easily. 
                      Unlike, encryption and description.
                      
2) Unique --> There is never two similar hash values. 
              If two hash is found to be same. Then, it is called as 'hash collision'.
              
              
The hash value is generated through SIH-256 .

SIH-256-->  stands for secure hashing algorithms.
            type of hashing algorithms.
            used to convert data of any length into a fixed size of string of 256 bits.
            
Properties of hashing algorithm-> 
 
1) One Way -> Once the data is hashed . It can't be dehashed easily.
2) Deterministic -> It gives same hash value for a  particular data.
3) Fast Computation
4) WithStand Collisions -> No one can hack.
5) Avalance Effect -> If there is very minor change in the input data. Then, the whole hash value will change drastically.
