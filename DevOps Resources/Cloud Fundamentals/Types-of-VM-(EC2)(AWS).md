<h1 align="center"> Types of EC2 Instances (Virtual Machines) </h1>

<p>Instances are differentiated on the basics of there use cases and configurations i.e RAM, Processor and Storage.</p>

### General Purpose
  * This are general purpose Instances.
  * They have balance in compute, memory and networking.
  * Uses :
    * It can be used for works like web crawling, virus testing and more.
    * It can also be used for deploying codes and making web servers.
### Compute Optimized
  * It is ideal for appication hat require heavy computation
  * It gives you high performance processors.
  * Uses :
    * It is used in making high performance web servers.
    * It is used for works which need high computation power.
### Memory Optimised
  * It provides fast and efficient performance for workloads that process large amount of data.
  * Uses
    * Big Data
    * Heavy Databases.
### Accelerated Computing
  * It uses configurations like hardware accelerator.
  * Uses :
    * Floating point number calculations.
    * Graphics Processing
    * Machine Learning Models
### Storage Purpose
  * It is designed for workloads that require high, squential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage.
  * Uses :
    * Low Latency
    * Random I/O operations per second (IOPS) to aplications.
